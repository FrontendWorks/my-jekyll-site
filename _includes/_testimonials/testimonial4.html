		<p>During AgileByExample I was pleased to hear Karthik's speech. I must say it was amazing. After few minutes simple topic about stand-ups, became the speech about commitment, business value and respect. Shown in humourus way (Tom and Jerry - rules!!) made me think about it deeply. Shown my team's problems and gave me new possibilities of how to react, remove waste and coach about what is the most important - value. Karthik is great speaker. He really knows what is he talking about.</p>
